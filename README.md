# Language_Classifcation
<p> The project is to build a rather simple neural network that distinguish between words and non-words.</p>
<p> The data is taken from https://osf.io/rpx87/, where there are way more information than needed, since the project is about reaction time, while we only needed a dictionary of words.</p>
