# Language_Classification
<p> The project is to build a rather simple neural network that distinguish between words and non-words.</p>
<p> The data is taken from https://osf.io/rpx87/, where there are way more information than needed, since the project is about reaction time, while we only needed a dictionary of words.</p>
## Version 1
<p> As for now the architecture saved in the notebooks is not particularly good, as it only achieves 75% accuracy on the test set, altough it should be possible to improve it (as soon as I have more time).</p>
